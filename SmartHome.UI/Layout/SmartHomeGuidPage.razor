@attribute [Authorize]

@* 
    use "@inherits SmartHomeGuidPage" at the top of your page
    when the page is releated to a specific smarthome (pretty much all pages)

    what this does, this captures the {SmartGuid} page varible
    it then tries to convert it and sets the state for other components to use

    ApiService auto injects it into any SmartHomeRequest, so you dont have to pass it


    to use this use "@inherits SmartHomeGuidPage" at the top of your page
*@

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string? SmartGuid { get; set; } //should come from url/@page
}
