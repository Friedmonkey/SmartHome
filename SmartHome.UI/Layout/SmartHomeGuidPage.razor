@attribute [Authorize]

@* 
    use "@inherits SmartHomeGuidPage" at the top of your page
    when the page is releated to a specific smarthome (pretty much all pages)

    what this does, this captures the {SmartGuid} page varible
    because it needs to have it or it will crash
    the actual handeling of this value is done separately in SelectedSmartHomeService
    SelectedSmartHomeService gets the most acurate and up to date GUID from the url

    ApiService auto injects it into any SmartHomeRequest, so you dont have to pass it
*@

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public string? SmartGuid { get; set; } //should come from url/@page
}
